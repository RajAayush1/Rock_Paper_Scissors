# Rock_Paper_Scissors
Developed the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors using a pre-trained neural network (SqueezeNet). This game is to be played between the User and the Computer

1. Two python programs were used to execute this project.
2. 'gather.py' file uses OpenCV to collect the training data.
3. Using this file, four different datasets were developed, namely, 'rock', 'paper', 'scissor' and 'none'.
4. Our neural network was trained on the gathered dataset using transfer learning 'Squeezenet'.
5. The model was trained for 10 epochs. 
6. The 'Rock-paper-scissors.ipynb' file can be run to play this small game with the computer in real time.
7. There are two frames created using OpenCV. One of the frames is used by user and the other is used by the computer. Name of the winner (either the 'User'or the 'Computer') is dislayed on the screen.
